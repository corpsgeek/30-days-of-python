The semantics of an operator depends upon the type of its operands:

```jsx
a = 1 
b = 2 

a+b == Addition 
but:
a = 'peter'
b = 'paul'

a = b = contactenation
```

## Equality Operators

is tests for same identity
is not different identity
== tests for equivalent
!= tests for not equivalent

## Comparison Operators

< less than
<= less than or equal to
> greater than
>= greater than or equal to

## Arithmetic Operators

+ addition
− subtraction
multiplication
/ true division
// integer division
% the modulo operator

## Bitwise Operators

∼ bitwise complement (prefix unary operator)
& bitwise and
| bitwise or
ˆ bitwise exclusive-or
<< shift bits left, filling in with zeros
>> shift bits right, filling in with sign bi

The notation val in s can be used for any of the sequences to see if there is an
element equivalent to val in the sequence

## Operators for Sets

key in s containment check
key not in s non-containment check
s1 == s2
s1 is equivalent to s2
s1 != s2
s1 is not equivalent to s2
s1 <= s2
s1 is subset of s2
s1 < s2
s1 is proper subset of s2
s1 >= s2
s1 is superset of s2
s1 > s2
s1 is proper superset of s2
s1 | s2
the union of s1 and s2
s1 & s2
the intersection of s1 and s2
s1 − s2
the set of elements in s1 but not s2
s1 ˆ s2
the set of elements in precisely one of s1 or s2

## Operators in dictionary

d[key] value associated with given key
d[key] = value set (or reset) the value associated with given key
del d[key] remove key and its associated value from dictionary
key in d containment check
key not in d non-containment checl
d1 == d2
d1 != d2
